		<p><b>Overview:</b> Fallout 1, the first adventure into the post-apocalyptic America of the Fallout series, was released September 30, 1997. The game features turn-based combat from a top-down view, as well as a huge game world to explore.</p>
		<p><b>Story:</b> The game takes place in 2161, 84 years after the Great War in that consumed the world and begins in Vault 13, the protagonist's home. Vault 13's water chip, a computer chip responsible for the water recycling and pumping machinery, has broken. The Vault Overseer tasks the protagonist with finding a replacement. They are given a portable device called the "Pip-Boy 2000" which keeps track of mapmaking, quest objectives, and various bookkeeping aspects.</p>
		<p>Armed with the Pip-Boy 2000 and meager equipment, the protagonist is sent out into the remains of California to find another water chip. Along the way, the Vault Dweller finds threats to the whole wasteland and fights against the evil Master as he tries to crush the wasteland beneath the strength of his mutated army.</p>

		<p><b>Overview:</b> Released on September 30, 1998, exactly one year after Fallout 1, Fallout 2 recreates the post-apocalyptic wasteland of California in the 22nd century. It introduced many changes and upgrades to gameplay, including better graphics, more items, better balanced combat, and a more intuitive character skill system.</p>
		<p><b>Story:</b> At the end of the original Fallout, the hero, the Vault Dweller, was exiled by the Vault Overseer for prolonged exposure to the outside world. Unable to return home, the Vault Dweller, with a group of willing companions, traveled far north. Eventually they started their own tribal village called Arroyo in what we know as Oregon. Decades have passed since the original Fallout, and the Vault Dweller disappeared from Arroyo after writing his memoirs. <p>
		<p>During 2241, the humble village of Arroyo suffered the worst drought on record. Faced with this hardship, the village elder asked the direct descendant of the Vault Dweller, referred to as the Chosen One, to perform the quest of retrieving a Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K) for Arroyo. The GECK is a device that can create thriving communities out of the post-apocalyptic wasteland.</p>

		<p>The player, assuming the role of the Chosen One, is given nothing more than the Vault Dweller's jumpsuit, a RobCo Pip-Boy 2000 handheld device, a Vault 13 water flask, and some cash to start this quest.</p>

		<p>The player eventually finds Vault 13 (the first place possible to obtain a GECK) devoid of the majority of its former human inhabitants. The Chosen One returns to find his village captured by the Enclave, a mysterious group which is later revealed to be the remnants of the pre-War United States federal government. The player, through a variety of means, activates an ancient oil tanker and its autopilot, thus allowing him to reach the Enclave's main base on an offshore oil rig.</p>

		<p>It is revealed that the dwellers of Vault 13 were captured as well, to be used as test subjects for FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus), alongside Arroyo tribesmen and women. Vault 13 was supposed to be closed for 200 years as part of a Vault-Tec Vault experiment; this makes them perfect test subjects. The Enclave modified the Forced Evolutionary Virus into an airborne disease, designed to attack any living creatures with mutated DNA. With all genetic impurities removed, the Enclave (who remain protected from radiation) could take over.</p>

		<p>The Chosen One frees both his village (Arroyo) and the Vault 13 dwellers from Enclave control, and destroys the Enclave's oil rig. In the ending, the inhabitants of Vault 13 and Arroyo create a new prosperous community with the help of the GECK together. </p>

		<img src="images/f3screen.jpg" alt="Fallout 3 screenshot">
		<p><b>Overview:</b> The first Fallout game released in the new millenium, Fallout 3 marked the first Fallout game made by current owner of the franchise Bethesda Softworks and was the first to feature a first-person view and live combat. The game was released in 2008 and completely changed gameplay from its predecessors and featured a completely different setting.</p>
		<p><b>Story:</b> The game is set in a post-apocalyptic, retro-futuristic Washington, D.C. following the Great War between the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and other countries.</p>
		
		<p>The introductory sequence introduces the Lone Wanderer (player) to their character's father James, a doctor and scientist in Vault 101. James frequently makes comments about the player character's deceased mother Catherine, and her favorite Bible passage, Revelation 21:6, which speaks of "the waters of life".</p>

		<p>The main quest begins after the player is forced to flee Vault 101 when James leaves the vault, throwing it into anarchy and causing the paranoid Overseer to send his security force after the player. The search for James takes the character on a journey through the Wasteland, first to the nearby town of Megaton, named for the undetonated atomic bomb at the center of town, then the Galaxy News Radio station, whose enthusiastic DJ Three Dog gives the player the moniker of "The Lone Wanderer". The player travels to Rivet City, a derelict aircraft carrier now serving as a fortified human settlement. Here the player meets Doctor Li, a scientist who worked alongside the player's father. Doctor Li informs the player of Project Purity, a plan conceived by Catherine and James to purify all the water in the Tidal Basin and eventually the entire Potomac River with a giant water purifier built in the Jefferson Memorial. However, continued delays and Catherine's death during childbirth put an end to the project, and James took the player's character as a newborn to raise them in the safety of Vault 101.</p>

		<p>After investigating the Jefferson Memorial, the Lone Wanderer tracks James to Vault 112, and frees him from a virtual reality program being run by the Vault's sadistic Overseer, Dr. Braun. James and the player return to Rivet City, and James reveals he sought out Braun for information on the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.), a device that contains the components needed to finally activate Project Purity. James and Doctor Li lead a team of Rivet City scientists to the memorial with intent to restart the project, but the memorial is invaded by the Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from the remnants of the pre-War United States government. James floods the project's control room with radiation to stop the Enclave military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn, from taking control of it, killing himself (but Autumn survives), his last words urging his child to run. The Lone Wanderer and Dr. Li flee to the ruins of the Pentagon, now a base for the Brotherhood of Steel and now known as the Citadel. With Project Purity still inoperational even with the Enclave occupying the site, the player travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K. and finish James's work. The player finds the Vault to be a testing site for the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus), and the source of the Super Mutants in the Capital Wasteland. After the player acquires the G.E.C.K., the Wanderer is ambushed by the Enclave and captured.</p>

		<p>At the Enclave base at Raven Rock, the player is freed from their cell by the Enclave leader, President John Henry Eden, who requests a private audience with them. En route to his office however, Colonel Autumn defies Eden's orders and takes command of the Enclave military, ordering them to kill the player. Fighting their way to Eden's office, the player discovers Eden is actually a sentient ZAX series supercomputer who took control of the Enclave after their defeat in Fallout 2 on the West Coast thirty years ago. Eden wishes to repeat the plan of then-President Dick Richardson using Project Purity, infecting the water with a modified strain of FEV that will make it toxic to any mutated life. This plan will kill most life in the wasteland including humans, but the Enclave, due to their genetic "purity" as a result of their isolation, will be immune and free to take control of the area. The Wanderer, provided with a sample of the new F.E.V., is given a choice to either leave peacefully or convince Eden to self-destruct the entire base. The Lone Wanderer escapes Raven Rock and returns to the Citadel.</p>

		<p>With the knowledge they possess, the G.E.C.K. and the means to activate Project Purity, the Brotherhood assault the Jefferson Memorial, spearheaded by a giant robot named Liberty Prime. In the control room of Project Purity the player confronts Colonel Autumn, and has the choice to persuade him to give up or kill him. Dr. Li informs the player that the purifier is ready to be activated, but the activation code must be input manually, and also that the control room is flooded with lethal amounts of radiation. The Lone Wanderer is forced to choose between sending Sarah Lyons of the Brotherhood inside the extremely irradiated purifier or entering themselves. Whoever enters into the chamber inputs the code hinted at through the game, that being 21:6, and dies from a radiation spike.</p>

		<p>If the "Broken Steel" DLC is installed, the player survives if they activate it themselves, but they also have the option of sending one of their radiation-immune companions to enter the code and start the purifier with no casualties. The player also has the possibility to enter the F.E.V. sample into the water prior to activation, having adverse post-ending effects on the game's side quests.</p>

		<img src="images/fnvscreen.jpg" alt="Fallout: New Vegas screenshot">
		<p><b>Overview:</b> Considered by many fans to be a spiritual successor to the first two Fallout games, New Vegas was developed by the remnants of the studio that developed the original Fallout games and features a familiar Western America setting. New Vegas was released in 2010, but it seems unlikely that Bethesda will allow another developer the rights to Fallout.</p>
		<p><b>Story:</b> Set in the Mojave Desert areas surrounding the remnants of areas around and including Las Vegas, Fallout: New Vegas takes place in 2281, four years after the events of Fallout 3, thirty-nine years after Fallout 2, and one-hundred-twenty years after Fallout. The New California Republic plays a major part in the game's story, being in a three-way struggle amongst the Caesar's Legion slavers, and the mysterious Mr. House.</p>

		<p>The Courier, the player's character, was meant to deliver a package from Primm to New Vegas. However, he/she is intercepted by the Great Khans led by a mysterious man, who shoots him/her and takes the package, leaving the Courier for dead in a shallow grave. The Courier is later found by a robot named Victor, and is taken to the settlement of Goodsprings, where Doctor Mitchell saves his/her life. After the Courier is given some medical tests, the player is pushed back into the open world.</p>

		<p>Endings for Fallout: New Vegas are dependent on what actions the player took via quests during the game, with separate endings being shown for each major location, political faction, and recruitable companion.</p>

		<img src="images/f4screen.jpg" alt="Fallout 4 screenshot">
		<p><b>Overview:</b> Fallout 4 was released in November 2015 by Bethesda Softworks, as a direct sequel to Fallout 3. Fallout 4 is controversial for not referencing any events from any of the non-Bethesda Fallout games, but has been lauded for its revamped combat system and newly-created dialogue and crafting elements.</p>
		<p><b>Story:</b> Fallout 4 takes place in the remains of Boston in 2287, ten years after the events of Fallout 3. The game actually starts on October 23rd, 2077, the day of the Great War, with the player character, the player's spouse, and the player's son, Shaun, enjoying an idyllic life in Massachusetts, then known as the Commonwealth, before the bombs drop. The player's house is approached by a salesman looking to give the player's family a spot in the local vault, Vault 111, and no sooner than the  salesman leaves does an alert on TV announce the outbreak of the Great War and the shelling of cities across the world.</P>
		<p>The player and family run to the Vault and manage to enter just before a bomb explodes near Boston. The player is then cryogenically frozen along with the family, but awakens some time later to see a man and scientists unfreezing the spouse's chamber, killing the spouse, and taking infant Shaun. The player awakens some time afterwards to find they are the Sole Survivor of Vault 111. </p>
		<p>The Sole Surivivor exits the Vault to find a world forever changed by the bombs and sets forth on a quest to find Shaun that could change the Commonwealth wasteland forever. The Sole Survivor meets the Minutemen, who seek to protect the Commonwealth and see it grow; the Institute, a mysterious organization with unthinkable technology, even synthetically created robots indistinguishable from humans; the Railroad, who seek to free synthetic humans from the Institute; and the Brotherhood of Steel, who seek to cleanse the wasteland of any dangerous technology using any means necessary, as well as many small settlements fearing the unknown the Institute and Brotherhood offer.</p>
